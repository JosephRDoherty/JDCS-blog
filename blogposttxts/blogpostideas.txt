"Find something you want to learn. And learn it in front of others. Share your process.
    Share your successes, and more importantly, your failures. Help others who want to be on the same path."

“document, don’t create”. Share screenshots as you’re going along. Take photos of your process. Write down
    your thoughts in a notebook. Whether you share it or not, documenting your process has its own rewards.
